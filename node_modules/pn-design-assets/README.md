# PostNord, Sass Guidelines

```css
// resets 1 rem to 10px to make it easier to work with (mandatory if you want to use our web components)
@import "<your-path>/_pn-resets";
// import PostNord-Sans and apply it
@import "<your-path>/_pn-fonts";
// this is all of the font sizes that we've decided on in the design team. In short it's sensible default sizes for all text elements and a bunch of helper classes to align our typography standards cross site (we have a more in depth guide in the left panel of this site).
@import "<your-path>/_pn-typography";
// Our color palette, you can get an overview of this if you look in our Storybook
@import "<your-path>/_pn-colors";
```
